Here I am practicing control flow with if, elif, and else statements to print a Magic 8 ball.

You can type in your name and question into their respective variables to print out an answer from the Magic 8 Ball.

If you do not enter in a name, the 8 Ball will generate an answer with the pronoun "you".
If you do not enter in a question, the 8 ball will let you know that it cannot provide a fortune unless you ask something.
